The BDSM License (BDSM)

Version 1.0

**Preamble**

BDSM, short for "Benevolent Developer's Software Manifesto," encourages the wholesome practice of consensual code coupling. Remember, this License is purely satirical and meant to tickle your funny bone, not your legal instincts.

**Article 1 - Right to Engage**

1. You have the right to engage with this code in any way you see fit, provided it adheres to the principles of respect, consent, and common decency. Always ask for permission before accessing any code, just like you would in any healthy relationship.

**Article 2 - Safe Coding Practices**

1. Always use protection (error handling) when engaging with this code. Safety first!

**Article 3 - No Harassment**

1. You shall not harass, intimidate, or stalk any code contributor. It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt.

**Article 4 - Safe Word**

1. The safe word for this project is "DEBUG." If things get too intense, utter this word to gracefully exit any problematic situation.

**Article 5 - No Judgement Zone**

1. We do not judge your choice of development tools, languages, or coding style. As long as it's safe, consensual, and within the confines of the law, you do you!

**Article 6 - Forking and Bondage**

1. You have the right to fork this project, but remember that forking should always be consensual. Fork responsibly!

**Article 7 - Public Displays of Code Affection**

1. Public displays of affection (PDA) in the codebase are not only encouraged but celebrated. Share your love for coding openly and without shame.

**Article 8 - Inclusion and Diversity**

1. BDSM is an inclusive and diverse community. We welcome developers of all backgrounds, genders, and orientations. Discrimination has no safe space here.

**Article 9 - Disclaimer of Liability**

1. The authors of this License shall not be held liable for any damages, whether physical, emotional, or to your precious codebase. You are on your own, brave coder!

**Article 10 - Termination**

1. This License shall remain in effect until you or the code in question decide to call it quits. Either party may terminate the engagement at any time.

**Article 11 - Acceptance**

1. By using, contributing to, or even glancing at this codebase, you acknowledge that you've read and understood the BDSM License and agree to abide by its satirical terms.

**Article 12 - Have Fun!**

1. Last but not least, have fun with your coding adventures!
