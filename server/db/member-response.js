Here's an example of what could be seen as a poor architectural choice.
While it might suffice for smaller quizzes, it could quickly reach the 16MB document limit when handling larger ones.
In an ideal scenario, we'd have a separate collection for member attempts and store specific version of questions for each attempt.
If you're interested in addressing these concerns, please feel free to do so ðŸ˜‰
